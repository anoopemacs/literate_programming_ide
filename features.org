* Literate Programming IDE built in Elisp programming language and OrgMode markup language - Key Features

This document summarizes the features of a highly customized Literate Programming IDE built using Emacs Lisp and Emacs Org Mode.
If you are a programmer, please open the accompanying ide.org file on Github to see the implementation.

** Core Literate Programming Enhancements:

*** Smart Noweb Reference Handling
    Configured =org-babel= to expand noweb references (=\<\<Some Block\>\>=) by default on tangling and evaluation, but to keep them unexpanded during export (e.g., to PDF) for improved readability.

*** Disabled Noweb Prefix Repetition
    Eliminated the repetition of leading text before noweb targets in expanded code, ensuring cleaner tangled code.

*** Interactive Link Navigation (=M-.= and =M-,=)
    Implemented custom functions ( =anup/goto-definition=, =anup/goto-usage=) to intelligently jump between noweb definitions ( =:noweb-ref=) and their usages (=\<\<Target\>\>=) within the Org buffer. This feature is seamlessly integrated with =xref= and =dumb-jump=.

*** Dynamic Usage and Definition Links
    Developed a system to automatically insert and update clickable links within the Org file, showing where code blocks are defined and where they are used. This includes functions for:
    - =find-definitions=: Identifies all =:noweb-ref= definitions and their line numbers.
    - =find-usages=: Identifies all noweb targets (=\<\<Target\>\>=) and their usage locations.
    - =insert-literate-links0=: Orchestrates the deletion of old links, insertion of blank placeholders, and population of actual line-numbered, hyperlinked definitions and usages.

*** Error Reporting for Unresolved Nowebs
    Configured =org-babel= to raise errors if noweb references fail to resolve across all languages, ensuring code integrity.

** Emacs & Org Mode User Experience (UX) & Aesthetics:

*** Rich Text Rendering
    Enabled =org-hide-emphasis-markers= for clean display of /italics/, *bold*, +strikethrough+, _underline_, ~code~, and =verbatim= text.

*** Enhanced Heading Visualization
    - Utilizes =org-starless= to hide leading asterisks in Org headings, providing a cleaner outline view.
    - Customized font families, sizes, backgrounds, and foregrounds for different Org heading levels (e.g., using "Arcanite Slab" and specific color schemes), enhancing visual hierarchy.


*** Intelligent Line Wrapping
    Integrated =adaptive-wrap= and =visual-line-mode= to ensure wrapped lines maintain proper indentation, improving readability of long paragraphs.

*** Selective Content Visibility
    - Set =org-startup-folded= to "nofold" to show all content unfolded by default, except for =PROPERTIES= drawers.
    - =org-hide-drawer-startup= hides result and other drawers on file open, reducing visual clutter.
    - (Previously) Implemented a feature to hide source blocks marked with =:hidden= on file startup, encouraging a prose-first reading experience.

*** Custom Code Block Theming
    - Configured =org-block-begin-line=, =org-block-end-line=, and =org-block= faces to provide subdued, GitHub-like light grey backgrounds for source blocks, and less obtrusive delimiters.
    - Enabled =rainbow-mode= in Emacs Lisp buffers to display hex color codes, aiding theme customization.
    - Customized the appearance of =:PROPERTIES:= drawers and special keywords with subdued foregrounds and white backgrounds.

*** Cursor Visibility
    Enhanced cursor color to "red" for improved visibility across various themes.

*** Full Line Fontification
    Enabled =org-fontify-whole-block-delimiter-line= and =org-fontify-whole-heading-line= for consistent background coloring of entire heading and source block delimiter lines.

*** Org Variable Pitch Mode
    Utilizes =org-variable-pitch= to intelligently switch between serif (=Alegreya=/=Atkinson Hyperlegible=) for prose and monospace for code/checkboxes, ensuring consistent vertical alignment.

*** Org Sticky Header
    Implemented =org-sticky-header= to keep the current Org heading visible at the top of the buffer, with a custom, visually distinct separator " ‚è™ " and hidden asterisks, enhancing navigation in long documents.

** Development & Tooling Integration:

*** Robust Navigation (Dumb Jump & Xref)
    Configured =dumb-jump= as the backend for =xref= ( =M-.=) using =consult-xref= for interactive selection with preview. Custom rules were added to =dumb-jump= to specifically treat Org files as Clojure files, enabling effective definition-finding within Clojure/ClojureScript Org Babel blocks.

*** Custom Literate Shell Scripting
    Configured =ob-shell= to load =.bashrc= aliases and environment variables, ensuring consistent shell behavior within Org Babel code blocks.

*** Export Control
    Set =org-export-with-sub-superscripts= to ={}= to prevent underscores and carets from being misinterpreted as subscripts/superscripts in exported documents, while still allowing explicit ={}= -enclosed subscripts/superscripts.
